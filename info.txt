Disclaimer from developer
For the sake of Sri Lankan current situation we had to make a solution for A/L students. That's why we built this project.
We think we chose the right decision for the future generation of this country. 
I am very thankful for those teachers who are trying to teach their students so far and I wish both of those parties to make the best of their part.
At this point I do not know am I right or wrong because I'm feeling guilty. But God made me to do this.
